<p> The adoption procedure is simple and free of charge.
Prospective owners need to come to the shelter 2 times and there is an adoption contract to sign.
</p>
<p> 
For the first visit we have a questionnaire – regarding your experience as a dog-owner, the living conditions the dog will have and etc. We will ask  some questions about your life and suggest dogs that might be the right match. </p>
 <p>    You are welcome to spend as much time with the dogs as necessary to make the right choice. There is a reason we ask you to come twice – often the emotional decision made at the shelter can be different from the thought-through decision you’d make in the comfort of your own home and after a discussion with your family.

 </p>

<p> When you are approved for adoption, you are welcome for your second visit – it can be done even on the next day. You can sign the adoption contract, receive the documents and medical history of your new friend and go home together.</p>
<p> We are very happy to keep in touch and help out in any way we can in the future. A member of our team might come to visit you at your home after an appointment.
To support you, our adopted dogs are treated at very low-fare prices at the Franziska clinic for the rest of their lives.
</p>
<p>
We have made sure that each of our dogs go home with: </p>
<p> 1. a full set of vaccine shots;</p>
<p> 2.a microchip and registration in the national database;</p>
<p> 3.an EU passport; </p>
<p> 4. spayed/neutered.
</p>
<p> The adoption of a dog from the Farm shelter is free of charge. However, the Farm is a non-profit funded by small donations –  we appreciate any help as it is a struggle every day. </p>
<p> Additional regulations: </p>
<p>You need to be over 18 y.o. to adopt from us;  </p>
<p>We only rehome dogs with people we have met personally, we do not ship;  </p>
<p>We have a right to reject a candidate based on the interview and our experience;  </p>
<p> We do not re-home puppies and young dogs with elderly people; </p>
<p> We do not re-home puppies or friendly animals as guard-dogs;</p>
<p> People who have already adopted from us do not need to go through the procedure a second time.</p>
